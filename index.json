Working with very advanced people, meeting with colleagues who understand you perfectly. Work at normal computers, in a harmless environment. Participation in the life of the country ‚Äî ‚Äúreal‚Äù, not ‚ÄúTV‚Äù. The opportunity to earn as much as you like, if you don‚Äôt want to ‚Äî downshift. Permanent professional conferences, seminars, meetings. There is a high probability of changing several countries of residence and continents. The probability of living an interesting and long life, because a loaded brain ages more slowly. There is always an opportunity to retrain, to teach someone. Even in retirement. As a rule, a positive outlook on the future.  Disadvantages:  The need for the first time, almost 2-3 years, to be at a tedious job or to be picked up in a large team. Constant inactivity, which you need to fight. Problems with blood circulation and nerves in the fourth decade of life. Dry eye syndrome can overtake in two to three years. Difficulty in choosing worthy managers. The risk of making a mistake in choosing a subject area that you will devote considerable time to studying. Fixed costs for upgrading the computer. Changing the subject area can lead to a return to the starting point of a career. Condemnation and misunderstanding of others when communicating on topics close to programming.

It is distinguished from other types of programming by the extreme correctness and stability of the final product, the strict separation of the scientific and interface parts, the individuality of algorithms, as well as the predominance of efficiency over versatility.\nScientific programming is at the heart of any modern global research. All advanced technologies ‚Äî from quantum computers to space programs ‚Äî would be impossible without specialists in the field of scientific programming, able to provide scientists with a reliable and accurate tool for making discoveries. A number of branches of science directly depend on the level of development of scientific programming. So, unmanned vehicles, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù control systems for urban and agricultural management, stock exchanges are waiting for their execution; robotics, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence that surpasses human capabilities are waiting for them.\nSpecializations Scientists use various programming languages, the choice of which depends on the type of task and the preferences of the author. Historically, the first high-level programming language is Fortran, it has written many well-established libraries of mathematical statistics and libraries for solving differential equations, which is relevant for economics and biology, respectively. Python has a simpler syntax, which is also suitable for programming mathematical calculations. Python is used for data processing in mathematics, physics, economics, biology, chemistry and is able to work with some other ‚Äúscientific‚Äù languages: Fortran, C++, C#. In turn, C# allows programming on the platform.NET, adapt the program to the common language runtime environment (CLR) and accelerate development in the framework of operational scientific sessions.\n** Great news - from a huge variety of activities, a programmer-scientist has the opportunity to choose exactly what best suits his abilities and at the same time proceed in this choice only from personal preferences.** Let ‚Äôs list the main types:\n ALGORITHMS.  Search, sorting, encryption, error detection in communication systems. This area will always attract the greatest attention to the practicality of the problems being solved;\n PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND COMPILERS.  This also includes the optimization of existing analogues. This is quite a creative and researchable niche, although the peak of its popularity is already passing.\n ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.  Everything that lies on the verge of fiction: text, image and voice recognition, semantic text analysis, self-learning neural networks and neural network programming as one of the most attractive and promising areas. It is this area that can offer maximum surprises;\n SUPERCOMPUTER AND QUANTUM THEORY  It is a complex of tasks and concepts that are still beyond our technological and intellectual capabilities.\n MULTICORE SYSTEMS  Development of the concept of accelerating the operation of systems through parallel multi-threaded programming. This area is rapidly gaining momentum.\n ROBOTS and PRODUCTION AUTOMATION.  It is a purely practical sphere, directly related to the industrial use of software developments, and therefore the most mastered since the 80s of the last century.\n CREATION OF VIRTUAL REALITY SYSTEMS  That‚Äôs where psychology and programming intersect most tightly. Ideally, work in this direction can bear fruit in the form of the emergence of new training systems.\n SYSTEM MODELING (CAD/CAM)  Engineering discipline, whose specialists are in high demand for solving problems of purely practical communication tasks, and it does not matter whether it is network communication, gas pipe or water supply.\n COMPUTER GRAPHICS  Solves an urgent range of issues related to developments in the field of accelerating graphics processing in computer systems, as well as improving color rendering.\nConclusion ** Programming moves science, which moves technological progress. Inventions that were considered revolutionary yesterday serve everyday needs in the XXI century: Microwave oven, mobile phone, 8-bit home computer. It depends on the programmer-scientist which peaks science will reach today and which of them will enter every home tomorrow.** In the hands of a programmer-scientist there are tools not only for the development of industry, but also for improving the overall quality of life. Such a specialist increases the prognostic function of humanity, helping to anticipate and prevent climatic, financial, humanitarian disasters.\n","date":1653696000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653696000,"objectID":"cb514bfcc7e97980857a61f64cb6d30a","permalink":"https://example.com/post/%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F/","publishdate":"2022-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F/","section":"post","summary":"Hi!

Markup language is a set of codes that, when applied to plain text, allows you to add one or more of the following properties (among others):\n Define the text Structure the text Describe the layout of the text Decorate the text One markup language you encounter every day (unless you‚Äôre a hermit) is hypertext markup language, or HTML. Websites and apps that bring you news and show you your email are built, at least in part, with HTML markup using tags as a mechanism to mark up raw text content. For example, consider the following HTML fragment:   Introducing HTML Here is a paragraph in HTML... we know it\u0026#39;s a paragraph because the surrounding \\ tags define it as one.\n Here, the ‚Äúp‚Äù tag indicates that all subsequent text, up to the closing tag, is a paragraph. In this sense, it defines the text as a paragraph.\nBut pay attention also to the ‚Äúbody‚Äù tags‚Ä¶ they often serve to determine the layout of a web page, for example, how many fields are on the side of the screen.\nAnd the ‚Äústrong‚Äù tags will decorate the word ‚Äúparagraph‚Äù in bold, and the ‚Äúh1‚Äù tags can both mark up the title (separate it from the surrounding text) and define a larger font.\nThe problem with some markup languages (among them HTML) is that entering these tags manually is a very tedious task. And with other languages like XML, tags and their attributes make up more of the overall content than the text itself!\nEnter a lightweight markup language If you wanted to take advantage of markup languages, for example by publishing an HTML page on the internet or converting a DocBook file to PDF so that it could be printed, you had to do one of two things. On the one hand, you can spend time learning these languages inside and out, writing them down manually, and then checking your work three times. Or you could invest the money in a tool that manages the complexity of them for you.\nFortunately, some enterprising developers have come up with a third option. They created new markup languages that contained many (in some cases most or all) of the functions of heavier analogues, but greatly simplified the syntax. These ‚Äúlight‚Äù languages include the familiar Markdown as well as Asciidoc, the Egc format in Org mode and the Mediawiki syntax.\nLightweight markup languages have a simple syntax One of the distinguishing features of these languages is that their ‚Äútags‚Äù (such as they are) should be intuitive. Let‚Äôs look at the previous fragment, this time written in Asciidoc:\n‚ÄúIntroducing Asciidoc ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì Where are the paragraph tags? We dont need them‚Ä¶ Asciidoc is smart enough to realize this is a paragraph!‚Äù\nMuch more readable, no? Starting from the top, we can identify the title, since it is ‚Äúunderlined‚Äù with strokes. You could do this if you were writing by hand, just draw an underscore under the page title in notepad. There are also no paragraph tags ‚Äî Asciidoc treats anything between two empty lines that don‚Äôt have any other markup on them as ‚Äúplain‚Äù paragraph text. Finally, the asterisks around the word ‚Äúparagraph‚Äù are indicated in bold. Raise your hand if you did it in a text message to mean the same thing.\nEach has one or more corresponding processors Heavy-weight markup languages usually have a special application for their interpretation. On the Internet, your browser and, possibly, a web server will turn the code into bright web pages. For documents in XML format, it can be something like Microsoft Word, which reads and writes in DOCX format. (this is another XML dialect). This way you will never have to interact directly with the source of these documents, only the cute facades that your applications show.\nMeanwhile, documents written in light languages are read by a person in their original form (another tenant), but only true nerds can consider them beautiful. To get a good result, you need to use a processor. These are applications that will consistently go through your markup and transform it into something else that looks good. The same projects that develop the language itself, as a rule, create a utility for its use. The Markdown project offers a Perl script with the same name, and the accompanying Asciidoc program is written in Python. In addition, other conversion utilities will include support for some of these languages. One such example is the excellent Pandoc, which will use Markdown, as well as lightweight tagging, restructured text, Mediawiki and Org-Mode and convert them to PDF, DOCX, ODT and others.\nAsciidoc markdown Pandoc formats As a result, lightweight markup languages allow you to work with plain text, the most portable data format on the planet, but in the end they still give a beautiful result. Now that you are convinced of its merits, which language to choose? Markdown is undoubtedly the most popular and has its advantages (more on this later). But Asciidoc, in particular, is a worthy alternative. In the next section, we‚Äôll look at a few reasons why.\nComparison of Markdown and Asciidoc The Asciidoc ‚Ä¶","date":1652486400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652486400,"objectID":"9b14e48643be26ff279ad5ac0553410a","permalink":"https://example.com/post/%D0%BE%D0%B1-%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85-%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%85-%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B8/","publishdate":"2022-05-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/%D0%BE%D0%B1-%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85-%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%85-%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B8/","section":"post","summary":"Hi! üëã Today I will talk about lightweight markup languages.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is a tool for converting code to HTML. The main feature of this language is the simplest syntax, which serves to simplify writing and reading markup code, which, in turn, makes it easy to correct it. Now let‚Äôs take a closer look at the functions of the Markdown markup language.\nMarkdown is not a replacement for HTML. The Markdown syntax is quite limited, and corresponds to only a small subset of HTML elements. It includes the following elements:\n Block elements   Paragraphs and Line Breaks; Headers; Quotes; Lists Code Blocks; Horizontal (dividing) lines.  Lowercase elements   Links; Text Selection; Code fragments of strings; Images.  Additional elements   [Backslash](#Backslash Escapes); [Automatic Links](#Automatic Links); HTML Special Characters.  For more information about the listed functions, see the section ‚ÄúSyntax Description‚Äù.\nSYNTAX DESCRIPTION Block elements  Paragraphs and line breaks In order to create a paragraph using the syntax of the Markdown language, it is enough to separate the lines of text with one (or more) empty line (any line that contains nothing but spaces and tab characters is considered empty). In order to insert a visible line break (the \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; element), you must end the line with two spaces and press the ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù key. Many elements of the Markdown syntax look and work much better when they are formatted using ‚Äúhard line translation‚Äù (line separation performed by the user himself, and not by the program automatically). Such elements include quotes, lists, etc.\n Headings The Markdown markup language supports 2 styles of heading designations: underlining and highlighting with a symbol (\u0026#34;#\u0026#34;). Headings are highlighted using underscores with equal signs (\u0026#34;=\u0026#34;) if the title is of the first level, and hyphens (\u0026#34;-\u0026#34;) if the title is of the second level. The number of underscores is not limited. When selecting headers using the symbol (\u0026#34;#\u0026#34;), from one to six of these characters are used, which are set at the beginning of the line (before the header). In this case, the number of characters corresponds to the header level. In addition, it is possible to provide the title with closing characters (\u0026#34;#\u0026#34;), although this is not mandatory. The number of closing characters does not have to match the number of initial characters. The level of the title is determined by the number of initial characters. The headings of the first and second levels, made using underscores, look like this:\nFirst level header Second level header The headers of the first, third and sixth levels, made using the symbol (\u0026#34;#\u0026#34;), look like this:\nThe header of the first level Third level header Sixth level header The above headings made with the symbol (\u0026#34;#\u0026#34;) are identical to the following:\nFirst level header Third level header Sixth level header As a result, the following is displayed on the screen:\nFirst level header Second level header First level header Third level header Sixth level header  Quotes The Markdown language uses the ‚Äúmore‚Äù (\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) sign to indicate quotations. It can be inserted both before each line of the quotation, and only before the first line of the paragraph. Also, the Markdown syntax allows you to create nested quotes (quotes inside quotes). Additional levels of citation marks (\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) are used to mark them. Quotes in Markdown can contain all kinds of markup elements. Quotes in the Markdown language look like this:\n This is an example quote, in which an angle bracket is placed before each line \u0026gt;.\n  This is an example quote, in which the angle bracket it is put only before the beginning of a new paragraph. The second paragraph.\n Embedding a quote into a quote looks like this:\n First Citation level\n Second level of citation\n Third level of citation\n  First Citation level As a result, the following is displayed on the screen:\n  This is an example quote, in which before each line an angle bracket is placed.\n  This is an example of a quote in which an angle bracket is placed just before the beginning of a new paragraph.\n  The second paragraph.\n Enclosed quote:\n First Citation level\n Second level of citation\n Third Citation Level\n  First Citation Level\n The citation level cannot exceed the 15th.\n Lists Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (unnumbered) lists. Markers such as asterisks, pluses, and hyphens are used to form unordered lists. All the listed markers can be used interchangeably. To form ordered lists, numbers with a dot are used as markers. An important feature in this case is that the numbers themselves, with which the list is formed, are not important, since they do not affect the output HTML code. No matter how the user numbers the list, the output will in any case have an ordered list starting with one (1, 2, 3 ‚Ä¶). This feature should be taken into account when it is necessary to use the ordinal numbers of the elements in the list so that they ‚Ä¶","date":1652486400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652486400,"objectID":"628afa0f9ae1544e0964c0984e4d0819","permalink":"https://example.com/post/%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0/","publishdate":"2022-05-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0/","section":"post","summary":"Hi! üëã Today I will talk about the design of the report in Markdown.

A version control system is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time and allows you to return later to a specific version. For file version control, this book will use the source code of the software as an example, although in fact you can use version control for almost any type of file.\nIf you are a graphic or web designer and you want to save every version of an image or layout (most likely you will), the version control system (hereinafter referred to as SLE) ‚Äî just what you need. It allows you to return files to the state they were in before the changes, return the project to its original state, see the changes, see who last changed something and caused the problem, who set the task and when, and much more. Using SLE also means in general that if you have broken something or lost files, you can safely fix everything. In addition to everything, you will get it all without any extra effort.\nLocal version control systems Many people use copying files to a separate directory as a version control method (perhaps even a directory with a time stamp, if they are smart enough). This approach is very common because of its simplicity, but it is incredibly prone to errors. You can easily forget which directory you are in and accidentally change the wrong file or copy the wrong files that you wanted.\nIn order to solve this problem, programmers have long ago developed local SLE with a simple database that stores records of all changes in files, thereby monitoring revisions.\nOne of the most popular SLE was the RCS system, which is still distributed with many computers today. RCS stores on disk sets of patches (differences between files) in a special format, using which it can recreate the state of each file at a given time.\nCentralized version control systems The next major problem that people face is the need to interact with other developers. In order to deal with it, centralized version control systems (CSCs) were developed. Systems such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce use a single server containing all versions of files, and a number of clients that receive files from this centralized repository. The use of CSCS has been the standard for many years.\nThis approach has many advantages, especially over local SLE. For example, all project developers know to a certain extent what each of them is doing. Administrators have full control over who can do what, and it is much easier to administer the CSCS than to operate local databases on each client.\nDespite this, this approach also has serious disadvantages. The most obvious disadvantage is a single point of failure represented by a centralized server. If this server goes down for an hour, then during this time no one will be able to use version control to save the changes they are working on, and no one will be able to share these changes with other developers. If the hard disk on which the central database is stored is damaged, and there are no timely backups, you will lose everything ‚Äî the entire history of the project, not counting single repository snapshots that have been saved on local developer machines. Local SLE suffer from the same problem: when the entire project history is stored in one place, you risk losing everything.\nDistributed version control systems This is where distributed version control systems (RCS) come into play. In RSKV (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients do not just download a snapshot of all files (the state of files at a certain point in time) ‚Äî they completely copy the repository. In this case, if one of the servers through which the developers exchanged data dies, any client repository can be copied to another server to continue working. Each copy of the repository is a complete backup of all data.\nMoreover, many RSCs can simultaneously interact with several remote repositories, thanks to this you can work with different groups of people using different approaches at the same time within the same project. This allows you to apply several approaches to development at once, for example, hierarchical models, which is completely impossible in centralized systems.\n  The template is mobile first with a responsive design to ensure that your site looks stunning on every device.

Why not go straight to the general comparison of Python vs Java? In fact, the reason is quite simple. This kind of brief overview will be useful for both beginners and more experienced programmers. How? Let me explain.\nIf you are already far advanced in the field of programming, you may not feel like you are doing most of the work on the machine, without even thinking about it. That is why it would be a great idea to go through the very basics ‚Äì this will allow you to refresh your knowledge, and to some extent test them. Although, of course, this approach will be most useful for novice programmers. In this case, they will not only be able to find out which language is better in general terms, but also which one is best suited for them. This is a winning situation for everyone!\nSo let‚Äôs start our comparison of Python or Java with a brief overview of Python.\nPython Python was created by Guido van Rossum and was first introduced to the general public in 1993. It is an interpreted, high-level programming language, by the way, object-oriented from and to. In fact, all this has become the reason why this language has become one of the most popular in the world.\nA high-level programming language (among other things) focuses its attention on simplicity. Python‚Äôs entire design philosophy is based on readability ‚Äì the language uses spaces and has a very simple syntax to accomplish its tasks. It has become widely known precisely because it is considered to be one of the easiest programming languages to learn.\nPart of its description, namely ‚Äúobject-oriented\u0026#34; is very important. OOP or object-oriented programming is a form of programming philosophy that focuses on objects and data, instead of the logic needed for management. Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation are just a few of the basic functions that define object-oriented programming. Why are OOP languages popular? Among other factors, which we will talk about later, OOP makes it easier to maintain the code and allows programmers to reuse it for other, separate projects.\nAs for usage, Python was originally created as a Linux development language, but since then it has become widespread in the field of web development.\nThese were some basic facts about Python ‚Äì they should help you lay down a fundamental understanding of the language and contribute to making a choice when choosing Python or Java. This is just one side of the coin ‚Äì next, let‚Äôs take a look at\nJava. Java was created at the same time as Python, but already by James Gosling and two of his colleagues. And, yes, that‚Äôs right, its logo really shows a cup of coffee, since the name itself was taken from the coffee brand of the same name. Finally, we managed to tell you about it.\nIf readability is the first thing that comes to mind when we talk about Python, Java also has its own associations. In this case, it is an acronym for WORA. WORA means ‚ÄúWrite Once, Run Everywhere\u0026#34; ‚Äì this is the slogan by which Java has become known and is related to the most notable feature of the programming language. Java is universal ‚Äì as the slogan says, it can be run on any platform and with any application.\nJava was developed based on C and C++. It was a kind of strategic maneuver, since these were the most popular programming languages of the 90s and the learning curve was much easier for those who already knew how to use C and C++. Although Java was not as ‚Äúpure‚Äù as Python, it was created as an OPP language.\nJava is most popular in Android application development and companies with large amounts of data. Considering this, for our comparison of Java or Python, these two languages do not pose a particular threat to each other‚Äôs fields of application.\nSo, you already know about programming languages from the opposition of Python or Java. However, to consolidate the information, let‚Äôs briefly discuss the differences between Java and Python.\nPython Or Java ‚Äì The Main Differences One of the first differences when choosing Python or Java is speed. Java is faster than Python, this is an indisputable fact. However, it is worth noting that this is applicable only for certain projects ‚Äì today modern processors are able to compensate for this disadvantage of slow programming languages. Although even with that said, Java is considered the fastest of the two. The main reason for this is that Python is an interpreted language and defines the data type at runtime.\nAnother difference in the confrontation between Python vs Java is the difference in the very process of writing code. Java requires you to write long and more complex lines of code, whereas Python is very short and requires a minimal amount of code. Moreover, Java requires you to specify the type of variables you want to use, whereas Python (being dynamically typed) does not require this.\nThese are just a few technical differences in the Python Java format.
